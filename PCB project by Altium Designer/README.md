This Altium Designer 14.3 project has been made by me, Victor Grigoryev. Library files were made by me too. If you use AD for work, there are no difficulties to made your own elements. 

Differences between original schematics made by Yves Lebrac and mine:
- 10kOhm resistor between reset pin and Vcc. You HAVE to place that resistor.
- reset button.
- two trim pots.
- three-pin-output. Yeah, that seems to be a strange decision, but still we are not going to build full-powered oscilloscope that costs 3k $ :D
