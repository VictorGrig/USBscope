This Sprint Layout 6 project has been originally made by Biker from cxem.net. He said that PCB is valid and working, I have never tried to make this variant. The main difference between original schematics made by Yves Lebrac and Biker`s is 10kOhm resistor between reset pin and Vcc. You HAVE to place that resistor.
